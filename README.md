# C-programming

Greetings for anyone who is reading this `README` file, i would like to introduce myself as `Cassian`, who are currently studying in OLLC as a freshman.
This was produce/made to help my fellow schoolmates & classmates to understand: 

What is C and how it works.

## Whats the purpose for this repository?
Before we tackle for the purpose of this repository. I'd like to explain for what is repository:

## What is a repository?

Its explanation will be explained in `2` types: 

#### Technical Answer:
A `Repository` or `repo` is a storage location for a project that is stored online and it was also made to have a version history (version control).
In which, we can track and regress our projects depending on some cases.

- In `Git`, a repository holds:
    - The projectâ€™s complete history of changes `(commits)`.
    - Snapshots of file contents `(called trees and blobs)`.
    - References `(branches, tags, HEAD)`.
    - Configuration files.

There are also `2` kinds of repository
- `Local Repository` -> This lives on your computer locally.
- `Remote Repository` -> Usually in a online cloud server (Github).

#### Short-Answer
Basically, a `Repository` is a way of saving your files (yes, any files) in an online cloud. Although this was primarly used by developers/programmers/scripters to maintain and share their code online to others (Open Source). 


You may ask: `How is it any different from online cloud services like g-drives, onedrive or even mega.nz?`

To answer that, lets have a look first on some examples.
