# C-programming (WIP)

Greetings to anyone reading this `README` file. My name is **Cassian**, and I am currently studying at **OLLC** as a freshman.

This repository was created to help my fellow schoolmates and classmates understand:

**What C is and how it works.**

## Whatâ€™s the Purpose of This Repository?

Before we tackle the purpose of this repository, letâ€™s first answer: **What is a repository?**

---

## What is a Repository?

Its explanation can be divided into two answers:

#### ðŸ”¹ Technical Answer

A **repository** (or *repo*) is a storage location for a project, complete with its **version history** (version control).
This allows us to track, revisit, and manage changes to our projects.

* In **Git**, a repository holds:

  * The projectâ€™s complete history of changes (*commits*).
  * Snapshots of file contents (*trees* and *blobs*).
  * References (*branches, tags, HEAD*).
  * Configuration files.

There are two main types of repositories:

* **Local Repository** â†’ Lives on your computer.
* **Remote Repository** â†’ Hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub).


#### ðŸ”¹ Short Answer

Simply put, a **repository** is like saving your files in the cloud. But unlike Google Drive, OneDrive, or Mega, it was primarily designed for developers/programmers to **maintain and share their code online** (often as Open Source).

### ðŸ“Œ How is GitHub Different from Regular Cloud Storage?

I'll put an example of some repositories here for referrence:

#### Example No.1 â€“ Learning by Projects

[`codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x`](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) helps learners build their own versions of popular tools (like Redis, Docker, or Git).

* Instead of just files sitting in a folder, this repo is a **structured learning path**.
* Developers can **fork** it, experiment, and contribute improvements.
* This shows how GitHub fosters *collaborative education*, not just storage.

#### Example No.2 â€“ Curated Open-Source Apps

[`dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps`](https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps) is a **living catalog** of open-source iOS apps.

* Contributors maintain an **index with links and descriptions**, updated continuously.
* Changes are tracked and reviewed through **pull requests**, unlike cloud storage where edits arenâ€™t version-controlled.

#### Example No.3 â€“ Free Learning Resources

[`EbookFoundation/free-programming-books`](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) collects **free programming books, tutorials, and courses**.

* On a cloud drive, this would just be static files. On GitHub, itâ€™s an **open, crowd-sourced library** with thousands of contributors.
* Every update goes through a transparent, version-controlled process.

---

###  Key Takeaway

GitHub repositories are not just about *storing* filesâ€”theyâ€™re about **versioning, collaboration, and community-driven contribution**.
While services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Mega are great for personal storage, GitHub enables a **global ecosystem where projects grow through collective input**.

##  Purpose of This Repository

As mentioned earlier, this repository is aimed at students in my department at **OLLC**. It was made to help them understand:

* What **C programming** is.
* How it works.
* How it has influenced languages like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), and many others.

By learning C, you will not only build a solid foundation in **how computers work**, but also open up many opportunities to learn modern programming languages that inherit much of Câ€™s syntax.

In short, this repository is about laying the foundation for becoming a versatile and confident programmer.
