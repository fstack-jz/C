# C-programming

Greetings for anyone who is reading this `README` file, i would like to introduce myself as `Cassian`, who are currently studying in OLLC as a freshman.
This was produce/made to help my fellow schoolmates & classmates to understand: 

__What is C and how it works.__

## Whats the purpose for this repository?
Before we tackle for the purpose of this repository. I'd like to explain for what is repository:

## What is a repository?

Its explanation will be explained in `2` types: 

#### Technical Answer:
A `Repository` or `repo` is a storage location for a project that is stored online and it was also made to have a version history (version control).
In which, we can track and regress our projects depending on some cases.

- In `Git`, a repository holds:
    - The project‚Äôs complete history of changes `(commits)`.
    - Snapshots of file contents `(called trees and blobs)`.
    - References `(branches, tags, HEAD)`.
    - Configuration files.

There are also `2` kinds of repository
- `Local Repository` -> This lives on your computer locally.
- `Remote Repository` -> Usually in a online cloud server (Github).



#### Short-Answer

Basically, a `Repository` is a way of saving your files (yes, any files) in an online cloud. Although this was primarily used by developers/programmers/scripters to maintain and share their code online to others (Open Source).

You may ask: `How is it any different from online cloud services like G-Drive, OneDrive, or even Mega.nz?`

To answer that, let‚Äôs have a look first at some examples.

#### Example No.1 ‚Äì Learning by Projects

The [`codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x`](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) repository is a **public repo** made to guide learners in building their own versions of popular tools (like a Redis clone, a Docker clone, or even a Git clone).

* Unlike cloud storage, where files just ‚Äúsit‚Äù there, this repo is **organized like a structured learning path**, with code samples, community contributions, and updates.
* Developers can **fork** (copy) it, experiment with their own implementations, and share back improvements.
* This shows how GitHub enables *collaborative education and growth*, not just file storage.

#### Example No.2 ‚Äì Curated Open-Source Apps

The [`dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps`](https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps) repo is essentially a **living catalog** of open-source iOS applications.

* Instead of simply uploading a zip folder of apps, contributors maintain an **index with links, descriptions, and resources**, updated by the community.
* Anyone can suggest additions through **pull requests**, and maintainers can review/merge them.
* This collaborative process is impossible with traditional cloud storage, where changes aren‚Äôt tracked or peer-reviewed.

---

#### Example No.3 ‚Äì Free Learning Resources

The legendary [`EbookFoundation/free-programming-books`](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) repo collects **free programming books, tutorials, and courses** across dozens of languages and topics.

* On a cloud drive, this would just be a folder of files. On GitHub, it‚Äôs an **open, version-controlled, crowd-sourced library** with thousands of contributors worldwide.
* Every new book or tutorial suggestion is submitted via pull request, checked for quality, and then merged into the main project.
* This turns the repo into a **community-powered educational hub**, not just static file storage.

### üí° Key Takeaway

GitHub repositories are not only about *storing* files, but about **versioning, collaboration, and open contribution**. Services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Mega work great for personal file storage and sharing, but GitHub enables something fundamentally different: a **global ecosystem where projects evolve through collective input**.

## The purpose of this repository.

Like what was stated earlier, this repository are aimed for the students in my department within my school (OLLC). And this was made to help them understand what is C, how it works, and how it was the foundation of some of the most famous languages like [`Python`](https://https://www.python.org/), [`C++`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [`Java`](https://www.java.com/en/), and many more.

By learning this, not only it will give you a good foundation on `how computers work`, it will also open alot of opportunities for learning many languages due to them using some of the `C's Syntax`.
